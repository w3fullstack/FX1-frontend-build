If you do provide sensitive information to us for any reason (for example, if you provide us with\r\n      | information about a disability you have), you consent to us collecting that information and to us using and\r\n      | disclosing that information for the purpose for which you disclosed it to us and as permitted by the Privacy Act\r\n      | and other relevant laws.\r\n\r\n    p In addition to the types of personal information identified above, we may collect personal information as\r\n      | otherwise permitted or required by law.\r\n\r\n    p Where you do not wish to provide us with your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with\r\n      | requested goods or services.\r\n\r\n    h3 3. Our purposes for handling your personal information\r\n\r\n    p As a general rule, we only process personal information for purposes that would be considered relevant and\r\n      | reasonable in the circumstances. The purposes for which we use and disclose your personal information will\r\n      | depend on the circumstances in which we collect it.

We therefore like to stay in touch with\r\n      | customers and let them know about new offers and opportunities. We may provide you with information about\r\n      | products, services and promotions either from us, or from third parties which may be of interest to you, where:\r\n\r\n    ul.ml-5\r\n      li you have consented to us doing so; or\r\n      li it is otherwise permitted by law.\r\n\r\n    p You may opt out at any time if you no longer wish to receive direct marketing messages from us. You can\r\n      | make this request by contacting our Privacy Officer, or by following the unsubscribe directions in a marketing\r\n      | message you receive.\r\n\r\n    h3 7. Cookies\r\n    p A cookie is a small text file stored in your computer’s memory or on your hard disk for a pre-defined period of\r\n      | time. We use cookies to identify specific machines in order to collect aggregate information on how visitors\r\n      | are experiencing the Website. This information will help to better adapt the Website to suit personal\r\n      | requirements. While cookies allow a computer to be identified, they do not permit any reference to a specific\r\n      | individual. For information on cookie settings of your internet browser, please refer to your browser’s manual.\r\n\r\n    p We may use third party vendors to show our ads on sites on the Internet and serve these ads based on a\r\n      | user’s prior visits to our Website. We may also use analytics data supplied by these vendors to inform and\r\n      | optimise our ad campaigns based on your prior visits to our Website.\r\n\r\n    h3 8. Data Analytics\r\n    p We share aggregated information regarding our users to certain Subscribers and other partners, sometimes for a fee.\r\n    p.ml-5 The information we share will not personally identify you unless you give us permission. This information may include:\r\n    ul.ml-5.pl-5\r\n      li providing a Subscriber or advertiser with information how users are engaging with their messages and content on the Website;\r\n      li providing a User with information directly related to their own engagement and behaviors on the Website;\r\n\r\n    ul\r\n      li providing general market data regarding the users of our Website such as general demographic, size and\r\n        | volume of certain interested products and services, and broader user trends and behaviors.\r\n      li We may engage third parties to aggregate and analyze the data and provide the reports.\r\n\r\n    h3 9. Accessing and correcting your personal information\r\n    p You may contact our Privacy Officer (see section 13) to request access to the personal information that we\r\n      | hold about you and/or to make corrections to that information, at any time. On the rare occasions when we\r\n      | refuse access, we will provide you with a written notice stating our reasons for refusing access. We may seek\r\n      | to recover from you reasonable costs incurred for providing you with access to the personal information we\r\n      | hold about you.\r\n    p We are not obliged to correct any of your personal information if we do not agree that it requires correction\r\n      | and may refuse to do so. If we refuse a correction request, we will provide you with a written notice stating our\r\n      | reasons for refusing.\r\n    p We will respond to all requests for access to or correction of personal information within a reasonable time.\r\n\r\n    h3 10. Overseas transfers of personal information\r\n\r\n    p Some of the third parties to whom we disclose personal information may be located outside Australia. The\r\n      | countries in which such third-party recipients are located depend on the circumstances. In the ordinary course\r\n      | of business, we commonly disclose personal information to recipients located in UK, Europe, North America,\r\n      | Asia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada. Our Subscribers and advertisers may also be located overseas.\r\n\r\n    p From time to time we may also engage an overseas recipient to provide services to us, such as cloud-based\r\n      | storage solutions. Please note that the use of overseas service providers to store personal information will not\r\n      | always involve a disclosure of personal information to that overseas provider.\r\n\r\n    p By providing your personal information to us, you consent to us disclosing your personal information to any\r\n      | such overseas recipients for purposes necessary or useful in the course of operating our business and agree\r\n      | that APP 8.1 will not apply to such disclosures. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that an overseas\r\n      | recipient breaches the Australian Privacy Principles, that entity will not be bound by, and you will not be able\r\n      | to seek redress under, the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\n    h3 11. Employees\r\n    p We collect information in relation to employees as part of their application and during the course of their\r\n      | employment, either from them or in some cases from third parties such as recruitment agencies. Such\r\n      | information may include contact details, qualifications, resume, current and former employment details, pay\r\n      | rate and salary, bank details, feedback from supervisors, training records and logs of your usage of our\r\n      | equipment (e.g. phones, computers and vehicles).\r\n\r\n    p Under the Privacy Act, personal information about a current or former employee may be held, used or\r\n      | disclosed in any way that is directly connected to the employment relationship. We handle employee\r\n      | information in accordance with legal requirements and our applicable policies in force from time to time.\r\n\r\n    h3 12. Resolving personal information concerns\r\n\r\n    p If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about this Privacy Policy, or how we handle your personal\r\n      | information, please contact our Privacy Officer (see section 13).\r\n\r\n    p When contacting us please provide as much detail as possible in relation to your question, concern or complaint.\r\n\r\n    p We take all complaints seriously and will respond to your complaint within a reasonable period.
